# Shellcodes

Repository with different shellcodes written by me in NASM assembly. Educational purpose only!

Check out [Shellcoder.py](https://github.com/Print3M/shellcoder/tree/main) - a simple script to automate shellcoding process and shellcode testing. I wrote this tool to keep focus on shellcoding rather than setting up a test environment. Enjoy! :)
