# Shellcodes

My shellcodes (or shellcodish-things) written for educational purpose in NASM assembly.

> **IMPORTANT**: Keep in mind that I write shellcode mainly for red-teaming applications (malware). It doesn't have to meet the requirements of shellcode injected via memory vulnerabilities (such as the absence of `\x00` characters).

Check out [Shellcoder.py](https://github.com/Print3M/shellcoder/tree/main) - a simple script to automate shellcoding process and shellcode testing. I wrote this tool to keep focus on shellcoding rather than setting up a test environment. Enjoy! :)
